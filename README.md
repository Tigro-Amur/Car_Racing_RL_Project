# Car_Racing_RL_Project

## 🥇 The goal of the project
- Compare RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN, DDPG, A2C) on exploration, stability, and domain generalization

## 📢 Contributions
- Quantitative and Qualitative comparison of leading RL algorithms under challenging conditions.
- Discrete action wrapping enables DQN vs actor-critic RL comparison in continuous control.
- Domain Generalization Test: testing in low-light environments after training with original/grayscale images.
